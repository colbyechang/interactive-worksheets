Suppose you have two coins, one that has heads on both sides and another that has tails on both sides. You pick one of the two coins uniformly at random and flip it. You repeat this process $n$ = $400$ times, each time picking one of the two coins uniformly at random and then flipping it, for a total of $400$ flips. Let $X$ be the number heads you get.

\begin{question}
How is $X$ distributed?

\begin{solution}
\hint{this is a hint! test}
\step{This is essentially the same thing as flipping a single fair coin, so we have $X \mathtt{\sim} \mathrm{Bin}(400, \frac{1}{2})$.}
\end{solution}
\end{question}
